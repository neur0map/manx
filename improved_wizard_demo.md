# Improved Manx Wizard Navigation

## 🎯 Fixed: Navigation is now integrated directly into choice menus

**Before (Problem):** Users had to make a choice, then navigate separately - causing extra clicks
**After (Solution):** Navigation options are included directly in each menu

## Example Flow:

### Step 1: Context7 API Setup

```
[Step 1/4] Context7 API
───────────────────────
🚀 Context7 provides access to official documentation from thousands of projects.
It's optional but highly recommended for the best search experience.

Without Context7:
  • Limited to hash-based search
  • No official documentation access
With Context7:
  • Search official docs from React, Python, Rust, etc.
  • Access to latest documentation
  • Better search results

? How would you like to proceed?
  Skip (I'll set it up later)
❯ Get a free API key (opens browser)
  I have an API key
  ── Navigation ──
  ← Back to previous step
  ✕ Quit setup
```

**Single click does everything!** User can:
- Choose their option directly
- Navigate to previous step
- Quit setup
- No separate navigation prompt needed

### Step 2: Search Engine

```
[Step 2/4] Search Engine
─────────────────────────
🔍 Choose your search engine - this affects how well manx understands your searches:

Hash Search (Default):
  ✓ Works immediately, no setup required
  ✓ Fast and reliable
  ✓ Perfect for exact keyword matching

Neural Search (Recommended):
  ✓ Understands meaning: "auth" finds "authentication"
  ✓ Better results for complex queries
  ✓ Small download (~22MB), runs locally

? Select search engine
  Hash Search (fast, no download)
❯ Neural Search (download small model ~22MB)
  Keep current setting
  ── Navigation ──
  ← Back to previous step
  ✕ Quit setup
```

### Step 3: AI Features

```
[Step 3/4] AI Features
─────────────────────
🤖 Enable AI features for comprehensive answers with explanations?

AI features provide:
  • Detailed explanations with code examples
  • Answers synthesized from multiple sources
  • Source citations for verification

Without AI:
  • Raw documentation snippets (still very useful!)
  • Faster responses, no API costs

? Add AI features?
❯ Skip AI features (use basic search only)
  OpenAI (GPT models) - most popular
  Anthropic (Claude models) - this tool's creator
  Groq (fastest inference)
  I'll set this up later
  ── Navigation ──
  ← Back to previous step
  ✕ Quit setup
```

### Step 4: Summary

```
[Step 4/4] Summary
─────────────────
🎯 Your manx is configured!

Configuration Summary:

  ✓ Context7 API for official documentation
  ✓ Neural search engine: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (semantic understanding)
  ○ AI features (raw docs only - still very useful!)

## ✅ Benefits of Integrated Navigation:

1. **Fewer clicks** - Everything in one menu
2. **Clearer options** - Users see all choices at once
3. **Better UX** - No separate navigation step
4. **Intuitive flow** - Navigation options clearly separated with `── Navigation ──`
5. **Consistent** - Every step has the same navigation pattern

## Technical Implementation:

- Each step returns a `WizardAction` directly from the choice
- Navigation options added to the end of every choice menu
- Visual separator (`── Navigation ──`) makes it clear
- Back/Quit options always available where appropriate
- Single interaction handles both choice and navigation

The wizard now feels much more natural and efficient to use!
